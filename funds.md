# Funds
An investment fund, or simply, a fund, is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group.

Collective investment vehicles that are regulated and sold to the general public on a daily basis.

Categories according to its investments: money market funds, bond or fixed income funds, stock or equity funds, and hybrid funds.

### Some definitions
**Money market fund**: open-end mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper.

**Unit investment trust (UIT)**:

**Exchange-traded fund (ETF)**: 

**Inverse ETF**: some index ETFs, known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the daily performance of the index.

## Hedge fund
Hedge funds are made available only to certain accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public. As such, they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight (e.g. no leverage limits).

## Classification according to the share issuance/redemption strategy
### Open-end fund
A collective investment scheme which can issue and redeem shares at any time.

#### Price and NAV
The **price per share, or NAV (net asset value)**, is calculated by dividing the fund's equity (assets minus liabilities) by the number of shares outstanding. This is usually calculated at the end of every trading day.

### Close-end fund
A collective investment model based on issuing a fixed number of shares which are not redeemable from the fund. Instead, the shares can be purchased and sold only in the market.

#### Price and NAV
The price per share is **determined by the market** and is usually **different from the net asset value (NAV)** per share of the investments held by the fund. The price is said to be at a discount or premium to the NAV when it is below or above the NAV, respectively.
