# Funds
An investment fund, or simply, a fund, is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. 


## Open-end fund
A collective investment scheme which can issue and redeem shares at any time.

### Price and NAV
The **price per share, or NAV (net asset value)**, is calculated by dividing the fund's equity (assets minus liabilities) by the number of shares outstanding. This is usually calculated at the end of every trading day.

## Close-end fund
A collective investment model based on issuing a fixed number of shares which are not redeemable from the fund. Instead, the shares can be purchased and sold only in the market.

### Price and NAV
The price per share is **determined by the market** and is usually **different from the net asset value (NAV)** per share of the investments held by the fund. The price is said to be at a discount or premium to the NAV when it is below or above the NAV, respectively.
