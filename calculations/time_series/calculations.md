## Drawdown

The drawdown is a measure of the decline of a time series from its historical peak. Given a time series $$x_t$$, the drawdown at time $$t$$ is defined as:


$$
\operatorname{DD}(t) = \max_{\tau \in [0,t]}(x_\tau-x_{t})
$$


### Maximum drawdown

The maximum drawdown in the interval $$[0,T]$$ is, therefore, calculated as:


$$
\operatorname{MDD}(T)=\max_{t\in [0,T]} \operatorname{DD}(t)
$$
